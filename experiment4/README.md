The point of this experiment is to compare the performance of naive and yy, on a bigann slice of 1'000'000 points. \

All of the outputs are placed in this experiment3/output folder, safeguarding files in other folders.
But they should be moved to a safe_output directory to prevent future runs of this experiment from overwriting previous results.

To run this experiment, type
sh experiment3/full_base_experiment.sh 
from parlaykmeans's main directory.

Then you will need to type in Y to confirm the experiment run.
