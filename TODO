7.5.23
- refactor to use more bare-bones IO spec for knn implementations
  - Input: points as flat array (n x d), n, d, max_iters, epsilon, (optional mutable k x d array of initial centers)
  - build accessor struct for said flat array w/ pointer and d
  - returns (centers, assignments, cost) as (k x d flat array, length n array of center indices, float cost (MSSE))

- reorganize in new repo
  - building with bazel
  - include with implementations and headers
    - IO subdirectory
  - kmeans.cpp which runs and compares for cli algorithm and dataset


Next steps:
  - Faithful Yinyang


Longer-term:
  - ANN on centers
