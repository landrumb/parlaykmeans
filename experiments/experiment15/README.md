The point of this experiment is to bench our different initialization functions. This benching has been done informally but this experiment will add graphs and csv files. 

This verion of the experiment running with more values of k, to
show linear scaling as k increases.

Note that the LSH method will abort if n % k != 0, this is why we are running
on very specific values of k.
