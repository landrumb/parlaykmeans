This is the description of experiment1.

This experiment was run on
commit 36309401aee321355424641e0ae2d5456d88cf94

on Andrew's Macbook Pro 2019.

The point of this experiment is to compare the performance of naive and yy, on a bigann slice of 1000 points. Even though 1000 points is too small to tell much of anything, we are doing this as a test of the experiment and graphing procedure. 

All of the outputs remain in this experiment1 file, safeguarding files in other folders.
