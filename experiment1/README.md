This is the description of experiment1.

The point of this experiment is to compare the performance of naive and yy, on a bigann slice of 1000 points. Even though 1000 points is too small to tell much of anything, we are doing this as a test of the experiment and graphing procedure. 

All of the outputs remain in this experiment1 file, safeguarding files in other folders.
